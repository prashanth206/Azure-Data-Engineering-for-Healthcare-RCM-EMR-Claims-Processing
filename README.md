# Azure Data Engineering Project - Healthcare Revenue Cycle Management (RCM)

## **Project Overview**  
This end-to-end Azure Data Engineering project focuses on Healthcare Revenue Cycle Management (RCM), covering patient treatment, insurance billing, data integration, and advanced analytics using Azure services.

## **Key Features**  
1. **Introduction to Azure Data Engineering:** Comprehensive overview of Azure services like Data Factory, Databricks, and Data Lake.  
2. **Healthcare RCM Process:** Deep dive into patient treatment workflows, insurance claims, and hospital revenue cycle management.  
3. **Data Architecture:** Implementation of a common data model to manage diverse hospital data sources, ensuring seamless data integration.  
4. **Data Ingestion Pipelines:** Generic pipelines for ingesting EMR and claims data using flat files and direct database connections.  
5. **Bronze-Silver-Gold Architecture:** Efficient data transformation using layered architecture to improve data quality and reporting.  
6. **Incremental & Full Loads:** Strategies for handling both incremental and full data loads, optimizing performance and storage.  
7. **Audit & Monitoring:** Implementation of audit tables to track data loading processes and ensure data integrity.  
8. **Advanced Data Processing:** Use of Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD) Type 2 for historical data management and tracking.  
9. **Security & Governance:** Secure credential management using Azure Key Vault and implementation of Unity Catalog for centralized metadata.  
10. **End-to-End Automation:** Automation of data workflows with conditional execution, parallel processing, and metadata-driven pipelines.
